Runs smooth. Looks sharp.
Power up: The latest 11th Generation Intel® Core™ processors deliver incredible responsiveness and smooth, seamless multitasking. Enjoy the extra power of optional NVIDIA® GeForce® MX450 discrete graphics with up to 2GB GDDR5 graphics memory.
 
Keeps its cool: A redesigned thermal system unleashes the power of your device while also preserving its thin design. Dual heat pipes move heat away from your CPU and GPU, more fan blades move more air and a drop-hinge allows air to circulate underneath your laptop.
 
Peace and quiet: With a fluid dynamic bearing system, your laptop's fan is not only long-lasting, but it also runs quietly while keeping your device performing at its best.
 
Better performance: Enjoy up to 2TB PCIe NVMe SSDs for responsive and stable performance on-the-go.
 
A does-it-all port: Available on configurations with an i7 processor, a Thunderbolt™ 4 port over USB Type-C™ supports DisplayPort and Power Delivery, meaning the one port can charge the laptop, connect to peripherals, and supply monitors with a display signal.
 
Strength meets style: Crafted with aluminum on the top cover and palmrest, your device feels luxurious without sacrificing durability.
