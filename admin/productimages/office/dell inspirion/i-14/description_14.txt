Ready when you are
On call: Staying connected with up-to-date applications has never been easier thanks to Adaptive Connected Modern Standby. Now your device stays ready, even when asleep, so you can quickly access files and applications whenever needed for an instant-on experience.
 
Fast charge: ExpressChargeâ„¢* minimizes the time you spend tethered to an outlet and will recharge your battery in a flash (up to 80% in 60 minutes*).

Ready to go: Your always-ready experience starts as soon as you open your device. Turn on, boot-up, and log-in quickly. A lid-open sensor gets the laptop started when opened, even if completely off or hibernating.
