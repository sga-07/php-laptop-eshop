Take every adventure to its peak
Guaranteed power: Experience powerful performance whether you're gaming or streaming thanks to AMD Ryzen™ 5000 H-Series Mobile Processors.

Keep cool: Our thermal systems utilize copper piping to dissipate heat as it’s pulled through the top of the keyboard and bottom of the system via four large exhaust vents.

Improved power: The latest improvements to our thermal design gives your system the thermal headroom to deliver ample power while adapting to a changing system load. This allows clock speeds to remain higher for longer, while keeping component temperatures cooler as well.

Storage makes all the difference: More storage means a faster start-up time which means you can get straight into gaming.

Full speed ahead: Killer™ Wi-Fi 6 AX1650 (2x2) technology, delivering data rates of up to 2.4Gbps and increased network capacity as well as Bluetooth® 5.2 support, for fast uploads and downloads, low latency and lasting battery life.
